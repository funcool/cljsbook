=== First steps with lisp syntax

Invented by John McCarthy in 1958, Lisp is one of the oldest programming languages that is still
around. It has evolved into a whole lot of derivatives called dialects and ClojureScript is
one of them. It's a programming language written in its own data structures, originally lists enclosed in
parenthesis, but Clojure(Script) has evolved the Lisp syntax with more data structures making
it more pleasant to write and read.

A list with a function in the first position is used for calling a function in ClojureScript:

[source, clojure]
----
(+ 1 2 3)
;; => 6
----

In the example above we're applying the addition function `+` to the arguments 1, 2 and 3. ClojureScript
allows many unusual characters like `?` or `-` in symbol names which makes it easier to read:

[source, clojure]
----
(zero? 0)
;; => true
----

For distinguishing function calls and lists, we can quote lists to keep them from being evaluated. The quoted
lists will be treated as data instead of as a function call:

[source, clojure]
----
'(+ 1 2 3)
;; => (+ 1 2 3)
----

ClojureScript uses more than lists for its syntax, the full details will be covered later but here is an
example of the usage of a vector (enclosed in brackets) for defining local bindings:

[source, clojure]
----
(let [x 1
      y 2
      z 3]
  (+ x y x))
;; => 6
----

This is practically all the syntax we need to know for using not only ClojureScript, but any Lisp. Being
written in its own data structures (often referred to as homoiconicity) is a great property since the
syntax is uniform and simple; also, code generation via macros is easier than in any language, giving
us plenty of power for extending the language to suit our needs.

=== The base data types.

The ClojureScript language has a rich set of data types like most programmig languages. It provides
scalar datatypes that will be very familiar for you such as numbers, strings, floats. Beyond these it also
provides a great amount of others that might be less familiar such as symbols, keywords, regex,
vars, atoms, volatiles...

_ClojureScript_ embrases the host language, and where possible it uses the hosts provided types. In this
case: numbers and strings are used as is and they behave in same way as in javascript.


==== Numbers

In _ClojureScript_  numbers include both integers and floating points. Keeping in mind that
_ClojureScript_ is a guest language that compiles to javascript, integers are actually javascripts native
floating points under the hood.

Like in any other language, numbers in _ClojureScript_ are represented in following way:

[source, clojure]
----
23
+23
-100
1.7
-2
33e8
12e-14
3.2e-4
----


==== Keywords

Keywords in _ClojureScript_ are objects that always evaluate to themselves. They are usually
used in map data structures to efficiently reprensent the keys.

[source, clojure]
----
:foobar
:2
:?
:foo/bar
----

As you can see, the keywords are all prefixed with `:`, but this char is only part
of the literal syntax and is not part of the name of the object.

You can also create a keyword by calling a function `keyword`. Do not worry if you don't understand
or are unclear about anything in the following example, the functions are discussed in later chapters.

[source, clojure]
----
(keyword "foo")
;; => :foo
----


==== Symbols

Symbols in _ClojureScript_ are very very similar to now known *Keywords*. But,
instead of evaluating to themselves, they are evalutated to something that refers to them, which
can be function, variables, etc...

Them are represented with something that not start with a number

[source, clojure]
----
sample-symbol
othersymbol
f1
----

Don't worry if you don't understand right away, symbols are used in almost
all our examples which will give you the opportunity to learn more as we go on.


==== Strings

Nothing new we can explain about strings that you don't already know. In _ClojureScript_ they
 work the same as in any other language. One point of interest however is that they are immutable.

In this case they are the same as in javascript:

[source, clojure]
----
"A example of a string"
----

The pecularity of Strings in _ClojureScript_ is due to it's lisp syntax, single and multiline strings
have the same syntax:

[source, clojure]
----
"This is a multiline
      string in ClojureScript."
----

==== Characters

_ClojureScript_ also lets you write single characters using Clojure's character literal syntax.

[source, clojure]
----
\a        ; The lowercase a character
\newline  ; The new line character
----

Since the host language doesn't contain character literals, _ClojureScript_ characters are transformed
behind the scenes into single character strings.


==== Collections

Another big step in explaining a language, is to explain it's collections and collection
abstractions. _ClojureScript_ is not an exception in this rule.

_ClojureScript_ comes with many types of different collections. The main difference between _ClojureScript_
collections and collections in other languages is that they are persistent and immutable.

Before moving on to all of these (possibly) unknown concepts, we'll present a high level overview
of existing collection types in _ClojureScript_.


===== Lists

This is a clasic collection type in languages based on lisp. Lists are the
simplest type of collection in _ClojureScript_. Lists can contain items of any type, including
other collections.

Lists in _ClojureScript_ are repsesented by items enclosed between parenthesis:

[source, clojure]
----
'(1 2 3 4 5)
'(:foo :bar 2)
----

As you can observe, all list examples are prefixed with the `'` char. This is because lists in lisp like
languages are often used to express things like function or macro calls. In that case
the first item should be a symbol that will evaluate to a something callable and the rest of the list
elemenents will be function parameters.

[source, clojure]
----
(inc 1)
;; => 2

'(inc 1)
;; => (inc 1)
----

As you see, if you will evaluate the `(inc 1)` without prefixing it with `'` char, it will resolve
the `inc` symbol to the *inc* function and will execute it with `1` as first parameter. Resulting
in a `2` as return value.

Lists have the pecularity that they are very efficient if you access to it in a sequence mode or
access to its first elements but are not very good option if you need random (index) acces to its
elements.


===== Vectors

Like lists, *Vectors*  store a series of values, but in this case with very efficient index access
to its elements and its elements in difference with list are evaluated in order. Do not worry, in
below chapters we'll go depth in details but at this moment is more that enough.

Vectors uses square brakets for the literal syntax, let see some examples:

[source, clojure]
----
[:foo :bar]
[3 4 5 nil]
----

Like lists, vectors can contain objects of any type, as you can observe the previos example.


===== Maps

Maps is a collection abstraction that allows store unique keys associated with one value. In other
languages are commonly known as hash-maps or dicts. Maps in _ClojureScript_ uses a
curly braces as literal syntax.

[source, clojure]
----
{:foo "bar", :baz 2}
{:foobar [:a :b :c]}
----

NOTE: Commas are frequently used for separate a key value pair but are completelly optional. In
_ClojureScript_ syntax, comas are treated like spaces.

Like Vectors, every item in a map literal is evaluated before the result is stored in a map, but
the order of evaluation is not guaranteed.


===== Sets

And finally, *Sets*.

Sets stores in an unordered way zero or more unique items of any type. They,
like maps, uses curly braces for its literal syntax with difference that uses a `#` as leading
character:

[source, clojure]
----
#{1 2 3 :foo :bar}
----

In below chapters we'll go depth in sets and other collection types explained in this chapter.


=== Vars

_ClojureScript_ is a mostly functional language and focused in immutability. Becuase of that, it does
not has the concept of variables. The most closest analogy to variables are *vars*. The vars are
represented by symbols and stores a single value together with metadata.

You can define a var using a `def` special form:

[source, clojure]
----
(def x 22)
(def y [1 2 3])
----

The vars are always top level in the namespace. If you use `def` in a function call, the var will be defined
at the namespace level.


=== Functions

==== The first contact

It's time of make things happen. In _ClojureScript_, a function are first-class type. It behaves
like any other type, you can pass it as parameter, you can return it as value, always respecting
the lexical scope. _ClojureScript_ also has some features from dynamic scope but this will be discused
in other section.

If you want know more about scopes, this link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_%28computer_science[wikipedia article]
is ver extensive and explain very well different types of scope.

As _ClojureScript_ is a lisp dialect, it uses the prefix notation for calling a function:

[source, clojure]
----
(inc 1)
;; => 2
----

The `inc` is a function and is part of _ClojureScript_ runtime, and `1` is a first positional
argument for the `inc` function.

[source, clojure]
----
(+ 1 2 3)
;; => 6
----

The `+` symbol represents a `add` function, in ALGOL type of languages is an operator and only
allows two parameters.

The prefix notation has huge advantages, some of them not alwats obvious. _ClojureScript_ does not
has distinction between a function and operator, everything is a function. The inmediate advantage
is that the prefix notation allows an arbitrary number of arguments per "operator". Also, it eliminates
per complete the problem of operator precedence.


==== Defining own functions

The function can be defined with `fn` special form. This is aspect of function definition:

[source, clojure]
----
(fn [param1 param2]
  (+ (inc param1) (inc param2)))
----

You can define a function and call it in same time (in a single expression):

[source, clojure]
----
((fn [x] (inc x)) 1)
;; => 2
----

Let start creating named functions. But that is means named function really? Is very simple,
as in _ClojureScript_ functions are fist-class and behaves like any other value, naming a function
is just store it in a var:

[source, clojure]
----
(def myinc (fn [x] (+ x 1)))

(myinc 1)
;; => 2
----

_ClojureScript_ also offers the `defn` macro as a little sugar syntax for make function definition
more idiomatic:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn myinc
  "Self defined version of `inc`."
  [x]
  (+ x 1))
----


==== Function with multiple arities

_ClojureScript_ also comes with ability to define functions with arbitrary number of arities. The
syntax is almost the same as define standard function with the difference that it has more that
one body.

Let see an example, surelly it will explain it much better:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn myinc
  "Self defined version of parametrized `inc`."
  ([x] (myinc x 1))
  ([x increment]
   (+ x increment)))
----

And there some examples using the previously defined multi arity function. I can observe that
if you call a function with wrong number of parameters the compiler will emit an error about that:

[source, clojure]
----
(myinc 1)
;; => 1

(myinc 1 3)
;; => 4

(myinc 1 3 3)
;; Compiler error
----

[NOTE]
Explaining the "arity" is out of scope of this book, however you can read about that in this
link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity[wikipedia article].


==== Variadic functions

An other way to accept multiple parameters is defining variadic functions. Variadic functions
are functions that will be able accept arbitrary number of arguments:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn my-variadic-set
  [& params]
  (set params))

(my-variadic-set 1 2 3 1)
;; => #{1 2 3}
----

The way to denone a variadic function is using the `&` simbol prefix on its arguments vector.


==== Short syntax for anonymous functions

_ClojureScript_ provides a shorter syntax for define anonymos (and almost always one liner) functions
using the `#()` reader macro. Reader macros are "special" expressions that in compile time will be
transformed to the apropiate language form. In this case to some expression that uses `fn` special
form.

[source, clojure]
----
(def my-set #(set %1 %2))

(my-set 1 2)
;; => #{1 2}
----

The `%1`, `%2`, `%N` are simple markers for parameter positions that are implicitly declared when
the reader macro will be interpreted and converted to `fn` expression.

Also, if a function only accepts one argument, you can ommit the number after `%` symbol, the
function `#(set %1)` can be written `++#++(set %)`.

Additionaly, this syntax also supports the variadic form with `%&` symbol:

[source, clojure]
----
(def my-variadic-set #(set %&))

(my-variadic-set 1 2 2)
;; => #{1 2}
----


=== Flow control

_ClojureScript_ has a great different approaches for flow control.


==== Branching with `if`

Let start with a basic one: `if`. In _ClojureScript_ the `if` is an expression and not an
statement, and it has three parametes: first one the condition expression, the second one
a expression that will evalute if a condition expression will evalute in a logical true,
and the third one will evaluated otherwise.

[source, clojure]
----
(defn mypos?
  [x]
  (if (pos? x)
    "positive"
    "negative"))

(mypos? 1)
;; => "positive"

(mypos? -1)
;; => "negative"
----

If you want do more that one thing in one of two expressions, you can use block expression `do`, that
is will explained in next section.


==== Branching with `cond`

Sometimes, the `if` expression can be slightly limited because it does not have the "else if" part
for add more that one condition. The cond comes to the rescue.

With `cond` expression, you can define multiple conditions:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn mypos?
  [x]
  (cond
    (> x 0) "positive"
    (< x 0) "negative"
    :else "zero"))

(mypos? 0)
;; => "zero"

(mypos? -2)
;; => "negative"
----

Also, cond has an other form, called `condp`, that works very similar to the simple `cond`
but looks more cleaner when a predicate is always the same for all conditions:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn translate-lang-code
  [code]
  (condp = (keyword code)
    :es "Spanish"
    :en "English"
    "Unknown"))

(translate-lang-code "en")
;; => "English"

(translate-lang-code "fr")
;; => "Unknown"
----


==== Branching with `case`

The `case` branching expression has very similar use case that our previous example with
`condp`. The main difference is that, case always uses the `=` predicate/function and its
branching values are evaluated at compile time. This results in a more prerformant form
that `cond` or `condp` but has the disadvantage of that the condition value should be
a static value.

Let see the same example as previous one but using `case`:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn translate-lang-code
  [code]
  (case code
    "es" "Spanish"
    "es" "English"
    "Unknown"))

(translate-lang-code "en")
;; => "English"

(translate-lang-code "fr")
;; => "Unknown"
----


=== Locals, Blocks and Loops

==== Locals

_ClojureScript_ does not has the variables concepts, but it does have locals. Locals as per
usual, are immutable and if you try mutate them, the compiller will throw an error.

The locals are defined with `let` expression. It starts with a vector as first parameter
followed by arbitrary number of expresions. The first parameter should contain a arbitrary
number of pairs that starts with a binding form followed of an expression whose value will
be bound to this new local for the remainer of the let expression.

[source, clojure]
----
(let [x (inc 1)
      y (+ x 1)]
  (println "Simple message from the body of a let")
  (* x y))
;; Simple messages from the body of a let
;; => 6
----

==== Blocks

The blocks in _ClojureScript_ can be done using the `do` expression and is ususally used
for side effects, like printing something in console or write a log in a logger. Something
for that the return value is not necesary.

The `do` expression accept as parameter an arbitrary number of other expressions but return
the return value only from the last one:

[source, clojure]
----
(do
   (println "hello world")
   (println "hola mundo")
   (+ 1 2))
;; hello world
;; hola mundo
;; => 3
----

The `let` expression, explained just in previous section, the body is very similar to the
`do` expression. In fact, it is called that is has an implicit `do`.


==== Loops

The functional approach of _ClojureScript_, this causes that it does not have standard,
well known statements based loops. The loops in clojurescript are handled using recursion.
The recursion sometimes requires additional thinking about how model your problem in
a slightly different way than imperative languages.

Also, many of the common patterns for which `for` is used in other languages are achieved
through higher-order functions.


===== Looping with loop/recur

Let's take a look at how to express loops using recursions with the `loop` and `recur` forms.
`loop` defines a possibly empty list of bindings (notice the symmetry with `let`) and `recur`
jumps execution after the looping point with new values for those bindings.

Let's see an example:

[source, clojure]
----
(loop [x 0]
   (println "Looping with " x)
   (if (= x 2)
     (println "Done looping!")
     (recur (inc x))))
;; Looping with 0
;; Looping with 1
;; Looping with 2
;; Done looping!
;; => nil
----

In the above snippet, we bind the name `x` to the value `0` and execute the body. Since the
condition is not met the first time is run we `recur`, incrementing the binding value with
the `inc` function. We do this once more until the condition is met and, since there aren't
more `recur` calls, exit the loop.

Note that `loop` isn't the only point we can `recur` too, using `recur` inside a function
executes the body of the function recursively with the new bindings:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn recursive-function [x]
   (println "Looping with" x)
   (if (= x 2)
     (println "Done looping!")
     (recur (inc x))))

(recursive-function 0)
;; Looping with 0
;; Looping with 1
;; Looping with 2
;; Done looping!
;; => nil
----


===== Replacing for loops with higher-order functions

In imperative programming languages is common to use `for` loops for iterating over data and
transforming it, usually the intent being one of the following:

- Transform every value in the iterable yielding another iterable
- Filter the elements of the iterable by a certain criteria
- Convert the iterable to a value where each iteration depends on the result from the previous one
- Run a computation for every value in the iterable

The above actions are encoded in higher-order functions and syntactic constructs in ClojureScript,
let's see an example of the first three.

For transforming every value in a iterable data structure we use the `map` function, which takes a
function and a sequence and applies the function to every element:

[source, clojure]
----
(map inc [0 1 2])
;; => (1 2 3)
----

For filtering the values of a data structure we use the `filter` function, which takes a predicate
and a sequence and gives a new sequence with only the elements that returned `true` for the given
predicate:

[source, clojure]
----
(filter odd? [1 2 3 4])
;; => (1 3)
----

Converting an iterable to a value accumulating the intermediate result in every step of the iteration
can be achieved with `reduce`, which takes a function for accumulating values, an optional initial value
and a collection:

[source, clojure]
----
(reduce + 0 [1 2 3 4])
;; => 10
----


===== `for` sequence comprehensions

In ClojureScript the `for` construct isn't used for iteration but for generating sequences, an operation
also known as "sequence comprehension". It offers a small domain specific language for declaratively
building lazy sequences.

It takes a vector of bindings and a expression and generates a sequence of the result of evaluating the
expression, let's take a look at an example:

[source, clojure]
----
(for [x [1 2 3]]
  [x x])
;; => ([1 1] [2 2] [3 3])
----

It supports multiple bindings, which will cause the collections to be iterated in a nested fashion, much
like nesting `for` loops in imperative languages:

[source, clojure]
----
(for [x [1 2 3]
      y [4 5]]
  [x y])
;; => ([1 4] [1 5] [2 4] [2 5] [3 4] [3 5])
----

We can also follow the bindings with three modifiers: `:let` for creating local bindings, `:while` for
breaking out of the sequence generation and `:when` for filtering out values.

Here's an example of local bindings using the `:let` modifier, note that the bindings defined with it
will be available in the expression:

[source, clojure]
----
(for [x [1 2 3]
      y [4 5]
      :let [z (+ x y)]]
  z)
;; => (5 6 6 7 7 8)
----

We can use the `:while` modifier for expressing a condition that, when it is no longer met, will stop
the sequence generation. Here's an example:

[source, clojure]
----
(for [x [1 2 3]
      y [4 5]
      :while (= y 4)]
  [x y])
;; => ([1 4] [2 4] [3 4])
----

For filtering out generated values we use the `:when` modifier like in the following example:

[source, clojure]
----
(for [x [1 2 3]
      y [4 5]
      :when (= (+ x y) 6)]
  [x y])
;; => ([1 5] [2 4])
----

We can combine the modifiers shown above for expressing complex sequence generations or
more clearly expressing the intent of our comprehension:

[source, clojure]
----
(for [x [1 2 3]
      y [4 5]
      :let [z (+ x y)]
      :when (= z 6)]
  [x y])
;; => ([1 5] [2 4])
----

When we outlined the most common usages of the `for` construct in imperative programming languages
we mentioned that sometimes we want to run a computation for every value in a sequence, not caring
about the result. Presumably we do this for achieving some sort of side-effect with the values of
the sequence.

ClojureScript provides the `doseq` construct, which is analogous to `for` but executes the expression
discarding the resulting values and returns `nil`.

[source, clojure]
----
(doseq [x [1 2 3]
        y [4 5]
       :let [z (+ x y)]]
  (println x "+" y "=" z))
;; 1 + 4 = 5
;; 1 + 5 = 6
;; 2 + 4 = 6
;; 2 + 5 = 7
;; 3 + 4 = 7
;; 3 + 5 = 8
;; => nil
----


=== Collection types


==== Immutable and persistent

We mentioned before that ClojureScript collections are persistent and immutable but didn't explain what
we meant.

An immutable data structure, as its name suggest, is a data structure that can not be changed. In-place
updates are not allowed in immutable data structures.

A persistent data structure is a data structure that returns a new version of itself when transforming
it, leaving the original unmodified. ClojureScript makes this memory and time efficient using an
implementation technique called structural sharing, where most of the data shared between two versions
of a value is shared and transformations of a value are implemented by copying the minimal amount of data
required.

Let's see an example of appending values to a vector using the `conj` (for "conjoin") operation:

[source, clojure]
----
(let [xs [1 2 3]
      ys (conj xs 4)]
  (println "xs:" xs)
  (println "ys:" ys))
;; xs: [1 2 3]
;; ys: [1 2 3 4]
;; => nil
----

As you can see, we derived a new version of the `xs` vector appending an element to it and got a new
vector `ys` with the element added.

For illustrating the structural sharing of ClojureScript data structures, let's compare whether some parts
of the old and new versions of a data structure are actually the same object with the `identical?` predicate.
We'll use the list data type for this purpose:

[source, clojure]
----
(let [xs (list 1 2 3)
      ys (cons 0 xs)]
  (println "xs:" xs)
  (println "ys:" ys)
  (println "(rest ys):" (rest ys))
  (identical? xs (rest ys)))
;; xs: (1 2 3)
;; ys: (0 1 2 3)
;; (rest ys): (1 2 3)
;; => true
----

As you can see in the example, we used `cons` (construct) to prepend a value to the `xs` list and we got
a new list `ys` with the element added. The `rest` of the `ys` list (all the values but the first)
are the same object in memory that the `xs` list, thus `xs` and `ys` share structure.


==== The sequence abstraction

One of the central ClojureScript abstractions is the Sequence, which can be though as a list and can be derived
from any of the collection types. It is persistent and immutable like all collection types and many of the
core ClojureScript functions return sequences.

The types that can be used to generate a sequence are called "seqables", we can call `seq` on them and get
a sequence back. Sequences support two basic operations: `first` and `rest`. They both call `seq` on the
argument we provide them:

[source, clojure]
----
(first [1 2 3])
;; => 1

(rest [1 2 3])
;; => (2 3)
----

Calling `seq` on a seqable can yield different results if the seqable is empty or not, it will return `nil`
when empty and a sequence otherwise:

[source, clojure]
----
(seq [])
;; => nil

(seq [1 2 3])
;; => (1 2 3)
----

`next` is a similar sequence operation to `rest`, but it differs from the latter in that it yields a `nil` value
when called with a sequence with one or zero elements. Note that, when given one of the aforementioned sequences,
the empty sequence returned by `rest` will evaluate as a boolean true whereas the `nil` value returned by `next`
will evaluate as false:

[source, clojure]
----
(rest [])
;; => ()

(next [])
;; => nil

(rest [1 2 3])
;; => (2 3)

(next [1 2 3])
;; => (2 3)
----

===== nil-punning

The above behaviour of `seq` coupled with the falsey nature of `nil` in boolean contexts make an idiom for checking
the emptyness of a sequence in ClojureScript, which is often referred to as nil-punning.

[source, clojure]
----
(defn print-coll
  [coll]
  (when (seq coll)
    (println "Saw " (first coll))
    (recur (rest coll))))

(print-coll [1 2 3])
;; Saw 1
;; Saw 2
;; Saw 3
;; => nil

(print-coll #{1 2 3})
;; Saw 1
;; Saw 3
;; Saw 2
;; => nil
----

`nil` is also both a seqable and a sequence, and thus it supports all the functions we saw so far:

[source, clojure]
----
(seq nil)
;; => nil

(first nil)
;; => nil

(rest nil)
;; => ()
----


===== Functions that work on sequences

The ClojureScript core functions that work on collections call `seq` on their arguments, thus being
implemented in terms of generic sequence operations. This also makes them short-circuit when encountering empty
collections and being `nil`-safe.

We already saw examples with the usual suspects like `map`, `filter` and `reduce` but ClojureScript offers a
plethora of generic sequence operations in its core namespace. Note that many of the operations we'll learn about
either work with seqables or are extensible to user defined types.

We can query a value to know wheter it's a collection type with the `coll?` predicate:
[source, clojure]
----
(coll? nil)
;; => false

(coll? [1 2 3])
;; => true

(coll? {:language "ClojureScript" :file-extension "cljs"})
;; => true

(coll? "ClojureScript")
;; => false
----

Similar predicates exist for checking if a value is sequence (`seq?`) or a seqable (`seqable?`):
[source, clojure]
----
(seq? nil)
;; => false
(seqable? nil)
;; => false

(seq? [])
;; => false
(seqable? [])
;; => true

(seq? #{1 2 3})
;; => false
(seqable? #{1 2 3})
;; => true

(seq? "ClojureScript")
;; => false
(seqable? "ClojureScript")
;; => false
----

For collections that can be counted in constant time, we can use the `count` operation:
[source, clojure]
----
(count nil)
;; => 0

(count [1 2 3])
;; => 3

(count {:language "ClojureScript" :file-extension "cljs"})
;; => 2

(count "ClojureScript")
;; => 13
----

We can also get an empty variant of a given collection with the `empty` function:
[source, clojure]
----
(empty nil)
;; => nil

(empty [1 2 3])
;; => []

(empty #{1 2 3})
;; => #{}
----

The `empty?` predicate returns true if the given collection is empty:
[source, clojure]
----
(empty? nil)
;; => true

(empty? [])
;; => true

(empty? #{1 2 3})
;; => false
----

The `conj` operation adds elements to collections and may add them in different "places" depending
on the collection. It adds them where it makes more sense for the given collection performance-wise,
but note that not every collection has a defined order.

We can pass as many elements we want to add to `conj`, let's see it in action:
[source, clojure]
----
(conj nil 42)
;; => (42)

(conj [1 2] 3)
;; => [1 2 3]

(conj [1 2] 3 4 5)
;; => [1 2 3 4 5]

(conj '(1 2) 0)
;; => (0 1 2)

(conj #{1 2 3} 4)
;; => #{1 3 2 4}

(conj {:language "ClojureScript"} [:file-extension "cljs"])
;; => {:language "ClojureScript", :file-extension "cljs"}
----


===== Lazyness

Most of ClojureScript sequence-returning functions generate lazy sequences instead of eagerly creating
a whole new sequence. Lazy sequences generate their contents as they are requested, usually when iterating
over them. Lazyness ensures that we don't do more work that we need to and gives us the possibility to
treat potentially infinite sequence as regular ones.

TODO

==== Collections in depth

Now that we're acquainted with ClojureScript's sequence abstraction and some of the generic sequence manipulating
functions it's time to dive into the concrete collection types and the operations they support.


===== Lists

In ClojureScript lists are mostly used as a data structure for grouping symbols together into programs. Unlike in other
lisps, many of the syntactic constructs of ClojureScript use data structures different from the list (vectors and maps).
This makes code less uniform but the gains in readability are well worth the price.

You can think of ClojureScript lists as singly linked lists, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the rest of the list.
This makes natural (and fast!) to add items to the front of the list since adding to the end would require to traverse the entire
list. The prepend operation is performed using the `cons` (construct) function.

[source, clojure]
----
(cons 0 (cons 1 (cons 2 ())))
;; => (0 1 2)
----

We used the literal `()` to represent the empty list. Since it doesn't contain any symbol is not treated
as a function call. However, when using list literals that contain elements we need to quote them to
prevent ClojureScript from evaluating them as a function call:

[source, clojure]
----
(cons 0 '(1 2))
;; => (0 1 2)
----

Since the head is the position that has constant time addition in the list collection, the `conj` operation
on lists naturally adds item in the front:

[source, clojure]
----
(conj '(1 2) 0)
;; => (0 1 2)
----

Lists and other ClojureScript data structures can be used as stacks using the `peek`, `pop` and `conj` functions.
Note that the top of the stack will be the "place" where `conj` adds elements to, making `conj` equivalent to the
stack's push operation. In the case of lists, `conj` adds element to the front of the list, `peek` returns the first
element of the list and `pop` returns a list with all the elements but the first one.

Note that the two operations that return a stack (`conj` and `pop`) don't change the type of the collection used for
the stack.

[source, clojure]
----
(def list-stack '(0 1 2))

(peek list-stack)
;; => 0

(pop list-stack)
;; => (1 2)

(type (pop list-stack))
;; => cljs.core/List

(conj list-stack -1)
;; => (-1 0 1 2)

(type (conj list-stack -1))
;; => cljs.core/List
----

One thing that lists are not particularly good at is random indexed access. Since they are stored in a single linked list
like structure in memory, random access to a given index requires a linear traversal in order to either retrieve the requested
item or throw an index our of bounds error. Non-indexed ordered collections like lazy sequences also suffer from this limitation.


===== Vectors

Vectors are one of the most common data structures in ClojureScript. They are used as a syntactic construct in many
places where more traditional lisps use lists, for example in function argument declarations and `let` bindings.

ClojureScript vectors have enclosing brackets `[]` in their syntax literals, they can be created with `vector` and from
another collection with `vec`:

[source,clojure]
----
(vector? [0 1 2])
;; => true

(vector 0 1 2)
;; => [0 1 2]

(vec '(0 1 2))
;; => [0 1 2]
----

Vectors are, like lists, ordered collections of heterogeneous values. Unlike lists, vectors grow naturally from the tail
so the `conj` operation appends items to the rear of a vector. Insertion on the end of a vector is effectively constant
time:

[source,clojure]
----
(conj [0 1] 2)
;; => [0 1 2]
----

Another thing that differentiates lists and vectors is that vectors are indexed collections and as such support efficient
random index access and non-destructive updates. We can use the familiar `nth` function to retrieve values given an index:

[source, clojure]
----
(nth [0 1 2] 0)
;; => 0
----

Since vectors associate sequential numeric keys (indexes) to values we can treat them as an associative data structure. ClojureScript
provides the `assoc` function that, given an associative data structure and a set of key-value pairs, yields a new data structure with
the values corresponding to the keys modified.

[source, clojure]
----
(assoc [0 1 1] 2 2)
;; => [0 1 2]
----

Note that we can only `assoc` to a key that is either contained in the vector already or if it's the last position in a vector:


[source, clojure]
----
(assoc [0 1 2] 3 3)
;; => [0 1 2 3]

(assoc [0 1 2] 4 4)
;; Error: Index 4 out of bounds [0,3]
----

Like with lists, vectors can be also used as stack with the `peek`, `pop` and `conj` functions. Note, however, that vectors grow
from the opposite end of the collection as lists:

[source, clojure]
----
(def vector-stack [0 1 2])

(peek vector-stack)
;; => 2

(pop vector-stack)
;; => [0 1]

(type (pop vector-stack))
;; => cljs.core/PersistentVector

(conj vector-stack 3)
;; => [0 1 2 3]

(type (conj vector-stack 3))
;; => cljs.core/PersistentVector
----

Since `map` and `filter` return lazy sequences but is common to need a fully realized sequence after performing those operations,
vector-returning counterparts of such functions are available as `mapv` and `filterv`. They have the advantage of being faster
than building a vector from a lazy sequence and making your intent more explicit:

[source, clojure]
----
(map inc [0 1 2])
;; => (1 2 3)

(type (map inc [0 1 2]))
;; => cljs.core/LazySeq

(mapv inc [0 1 2])
;; => [1 2 3]

(type (mapv inc [0 1 2]))
;; => cljs.core/PersistentVector
----

===== Sets

=== Namespaces

==== Defining a namespace

Namespaces is a clojurescript's fundamental unit of code modularity. Are analogous to Java packages or
Ruby and Python modules, and can be defined with `ns` macro. Maybe if you are touched a little bit of
clojurescript source you have seen something like this at begining of the file:

[source, clojure]
----
(ns myapp.core
  "Some docstring for the namespace.")

(def x "hello")
----

Namespaces are dynamic and you can create one in any time, but the convention is having one namespace
per file. So, the namespace definition usually is at begining of the file followed with optional
docstring.

Previously we have explained the vars and symbols. Every var that you are defines will be associated
with one namespace. If you do not define a concrete namespace, the default one called "user" will be
used:

[source, clojure]
----
(def x "hello")
;; => #'user/x
----

==== Loading other namespaces

It's ok, definining a namespace and vars in it is really easy, but it is not very usefull if we can't
use them from other namespaces. For this purpose, the `ns` macro also offers a simple way to load other
namespaces.

Observe the following:

[source, clojure]
----
(ns myapp.main
  (:require myapp.core
            clojure.string))

(clojure.string/upper-case myapp.core/x)
;; => "HELLO"
----

As you can observe, we are using fully qualified names (namespace + var name) for access to vars and
functions from different namespaces.

It is ok, we not can access to other namespaces but is very boring always write the complete namespace
name for access to its vars and functions. It will be specially uncomfortable if a namespace name
is very large. For solve that, you can use the `:as` directive for create an additional (usually
more shorter) alias to the namespace. Let see the how it can be done:

[source, clojure]
----
(ns myapp.main
  (:require [myapp.core :as core]
            [clojure.string :as str]))

(str/upper-case core/x)
;; => "HELLO"
----

Additionaly, _ClojureScript_ offers a simple way to refer specific vars or functions from concrete namespace using the `:refer` directive.

The `:refer` directive has two possible arguments: `:all` keyword or a vector of symbols that will
refer to vars in the namespace. With `:all` we are indicating that we want refer all public vars from the
namespace and with vector we can specify the concrete subset of vars that we want.

[source, clojure]
----
(ns myapp.main
  (:require [myapp.core :refer :all]
            [clojure.string :refer [upper-case]]))
----

And finally, we should know that everything that located in the `cljs.core` namespace is automatically
loaded and you should not require it explicitly. But sometimes you want declare vars that will clash
with some other defined in `cljs.core` namespace. For it, the `ns` macro offers an other directive that
allows exclude concrete symbols and prevet them to be automaticaly loaded.

Observe the following:

[source, clojure]
----
(ns myapp.main
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [min]))

(defn min
  [x y]
  (if (> x y)
    y
    x))
----

The `ns` macro also has other directives for loading host clases (`:import`) and macros
(`:refer-macros`), but them are explained in posterior sections.


=== Abstractions and Polymorphism

I'm sure that in more that in one time you have found in this situation: you have defined a great
abstraction (using interfaces or something similar) for your "bussines logic" and you have found
the need to deal with an other module over which you have absolutelly no control, and you probably
was thinking in create adapters, proxies and other approaches that will implies a great amount
of additional complexity.

Some dynamic languages allows "monkey-patching", languages where the classes are open and any
method can be defined and redefined at any time. Also, is very known that this technique is a very
bad practice.

We can not trust languages that allows that when importing third party libraries, can silently overwrite
methods that you are using and expecting a concrete behavior.

This symptoms denotes a commonly named: "Expression problem".

TODO: add link to expression problem description


==== Protocols

The _ClojureScript_ primitive for define "interfaces" are called Protocols. A protocol consists in
a name and set of functions. All functions have at least one argument corresponding to the
`this` in javascript or `self` in Python.

Protocols provides a type based polymorphism, and the dispatch is always done by the
first argument previously mentioned as `this`.

A protocol looks like this:

[source, clojure]
----
(ns myapp.foobar)

(defprotocol IProtocolName
  "A docstring describing the protocol."
  (sample-method [this] "A doc string of the function associated with the protocol."))
----

NOTE: the "I" prefix is very common for make clear separation of protocols and types. In clojute
comunity it there many dispare optionions about the use of the "I" prefix. In our opinion is an
acceptable solution for avoid name clashing and confusions.

From the user perspective, protocol functions are simple and plain functions defined in the namespace
where the protocol is defined. As you can intuit, this makes protocols completelly namespaces and
avoid any accidental clashing between implemented protocols for same type.


===== Extending to existing types

On of the big strengths of protocols is the ability to extend existing and maybe third party types
and this operation can be done in different ways. The majority of time you will be tend to use
the *extend-protocol* or the *extend-type* macros.

This is the aspect on how *extend-type* macro can be used:

[source, clojure]
----
(extend-type TypeA
  ProtocolA
  (function-from-protocol-a [this]
    ;; implementation here
    )

  ProtocolB
  (function-from-protocol-b-1 [this parameter1]
    ;; implementation here
    )
  (function-from-protocol-b-2 [this parameter1 parameter2]
    ;; implementation here
    ))
----

You can observe that with *extend-type* you are extending one type with different protocols
in one expression. In difference to that, *extend-protocol* do just the inverse operation. It,
given a protocol, add implementation for it to multiple types:

[source, clojure]
----
(extend-protocol ProtocolA
  TypeA
  (function-from-protocol-a [this]
    ;; implementation here
    )

  TypeB
  (function-from-protocol-a [this]
    ;; implementation here
    ))
----

It there other ways to extend a type with a protocol implementation but them will be covered
in other section of this book.


===== Participate in ClojureScript abstractions

ClojureScript it self is built up on abstractions defined as protocols, so almost all behavior
in the _ClojureScript_ language can be adopted for third party libraries. Let's go to see an
real life example.

In previous sections we have explained different kind of builtin collections, in this case we
will use the *Set*'s. See this snipped of code:

[source, clojure]
----
(def mynums #{1 2})

(filter mynums [1 2 4 5 1 3 4 5])
;; => (1 2 1)
----

But, that it happens where? In this case, the set type implements the _ClojureScript_ internal
`IFn` protocol that represents an abstraction for functions or any thing callable. So it can be
used like a callable predicate in filter.

Ok, but what it happens if we want use a regular expression as predicate function for filter
a collection of strings:

[source, clojure]
----
(filter #"^foo" ["haha" "foobar" "baz" "foobaz"])
;; TypeError: Cannot call undefined
----

Obviosly, this exception is raised because the RegExp type does not implements the `IFn` protocol
so it can not behave like a callable. But it can be easy fixed:

[source, clojure]
----
(extend-type js/RegExp
  IFn
  (-invoke
   ([this a]
     (re-find this a))))
----

Now, you will be able use the regex instances as predicates in filter operation:

[source, clojure]
----
(filter #"^foo" ["haha" "foobar" "baz" "foobaz"])
;; => ("foobar" "foobaz")
----


===== Protocols introspection

_ClojureScript_ comes with a usefull function that allows runtime introspection: `satisfies?`. The
purpose of this function is know in runtime if some object (instance of some type) satisfies the
concrete protocol.

So, with previous examples, if we check if a set instance satisfies a *IFn* protocol, it should
return `true`:

[source, clojure]
----
(satisfies IFn #{1})
;; => true
----


==== Multimethods

We have previously talked about protocols, that solves a very common use case of polymorphism:
dispatch by type. But in some circumstances the protocol's approach it can be limiting. And
here *multimethods* comes to the rescue.

The *multimethods* are not limited to type dispatch only, instead, them also offers dispatch
by types of multiple arguments, by value and allows ad-hoc hierarchies to be defined. Also,
like protocols, is a "Open System" so you or any third parties can extend a multimethod for
new types.

The basic consturctions of *multimethods* consists in `defmulti` and `defmethod` forms. The
`defmulti` form is used for create the multimethod with initial dispatch function. This is
a common look and feel of it:

[source, clojure]
----
(defmulti say-hello
  "A polymorphic function that return a greetings message
  depending on the language key with default lang as `:en`"
  (fn [param] (:locale param))
  :default :en)
----

The anonymous function defined within the `defmulti` form is a dispatch function. It will
be called in every call to `say-hello` function and should return some kind of mark object
that will be used for dispatch. In our example it returns the contents of `:locale` key
of the first argument.

And finally, we should add implementations. That is done with `defmethod` form:

[source, clojure]
----
(defmethod say-hello :en
  [person]
  (str "Hello " (:name person "Anonymous")))

(defmethod say-hello :es
  [person]
  (str "Hola " (:name person "Anonimo")))
----

So, if you execute that function over a hash map containing the `:locale` and optionally
the `:name` key, the multimethod firstly will call the dispatch function for determine the
dispatch value, secondly it will search an implementation for that value, if it is found,
it will execute it, in case contrary it will search the default implementation (if it
specified) and execute it.

[source, clojure]
----
(say-hello {:locale :es})
;; => "Hola Anonymo"

(say-hello {:locale :en :name "Ciri"})
;; => "Hello Ciri"

(say-hello {:locale :fr})
;; => "Hello Anonymous"
----

If the default implementation is not specified, an exception will be raised notifying about
that some value does not have a implementation for that multimethod.


==== Hierarchies

Hierarchies is a way that _ClojureScript_ offers you build a whatever relations that your
domain may require. The hierarchies are difined in term of relations betwen named objects,
such as symbols, keywords or types.

The hierarchies can be defined globally or locally, depending on your needs. Like multimethods,
hierarchies are not limited to single namespace. You can extend a hierarchy from any namespace,
not necesary the one which they are defined.

The global namespace is more limited, for good reasons. Not namespaced keywords or symbols can
not be used in the global hierarcy. That behavior helps prevent unexpected situations when
two or more third party libraries uses the same symbol for different semantics.

===== Defining a hierarchy

The hierarchy relations should be established using `derive` function:

[source, clojure]
----
(derive ::circle ::shape)
(derive ::box ::shape)
----

We have just defined a set of relationships between namespaced keywords, in this case the
`::circle` is a child of `::shape` and `::box` is also a child of `::shape`.

TIP: The `::circle` keyword syntax is a shortland for `:current.ns/circle`. So if you are executing
it in a repl, sureally that `::circle` will be evaluated to `:cljs.user/circe`.


===== Hierarchies introspection

_ClojureScript_ comes with little toolset of functions that allow runtime introspection
of the global or local defined hierarchies. These toolset consists on thre functions:
`isa?`, `anscestors`, and `descendants`.

Let see an example on how it can be used with hierarchy defined in previous example:

[source, clojure]
----
(ancestors ::box)
;; => #{:cljs.user/shape}

(descendants ::shape)
;; => #{:cljs.user/circle :cljs.user/box}

(isa? ::box ::shape)
;; => true

(isa? ::rect ::shape)
;; => false
----


===== Local defined hierarchies

As we mentioned previously, in _ClojureScript_ you also can define local hierarchies. This can be
done with `make-hierarchy` function. And this is the aspect of how you can replicate the previous
example but using the local hierarchy:

[source, clojure]
----
(def h (-> (make-hierarchy)
           (derive :box :shape)
           (derive :circle :shape)))
----

Now, if you can use the same introspection functions with that, locally defined hierarchy:

[source, clojure]
----
(isa? h :box :shape)
;; => true

(isa? :box :shape)
;; => false
----

As you can observe, in local hierarchies we can use normal (not namespace qualified) keywords
and if we execute the `isa?` without passing the local hierarchy parameter, its as expected
return false.


===== Hierarchies in multimethods

One of the big advantages of hierarchies, is that they works very well together with multimethods.
Because, multimethods by default uses the `isa?` function for the last step of dispatching.

Let see an example for clearly understand that it means. Firstly define the multimethod with
`defmulti` form:

[source, clojure]
----
(defmulti stringify-shape
  "A function that prints a human readable representation
  of a shape keyword."
  identity
  :hierarchy h)
----

With `:hierarchy` keyword parameter we indicate to the multimethod that hierarchy we want to use,
if it is not specified, the global hierarchi will be used.

Secondly, define a implementation for our multimethod using the `defmethod` form:

[source, clojure]
----
(defmethod stringify-shape :box
  [_]
  "A box shape")

(defmethod stringify-shape :shape
  [_]
  "A generic shape")

(defmethod stringify-shape :default
  [_]
  "Unexpected object")
----

Now, let see what is happens if we execute that function with a box:

[source, clojure]
----
(stringify-shape :box)
;; => "A box shape"
----

Now everything works as expected, the multimethod executes the direct matching implementation
for the given parameter. But that is happens if we execute the same function but with `:circle`
keyword as parameter, that does not have the direct matching dispatch value:

[source, clojure]
----
(stringify-shape :circle)
;; => "A generic shape"
----

The multimethod automatically resolves it using the provided hierarchy, and that `:circle` is
a descendat of `:shape`, so the `:shape` implementation is executed.


=== Data types

Until, now, we have used maps, sets, lists and vectors for represent our data. And in most cases is a
really great aproach for do it. But some times we need define our own types and in this book we will
call them *datatypes*.

A datatype provides the following:

* A unique host backed type, either named or anonymous.
* Explicitly declared structure using fields or closures.
* Implement concrete abstractions.
* Map like behavior (via records, see below).


==== Deftype

The most low level construction in _ClojureScript_ for create own types, is the `deftype` macro. For
demostration we will define a type called `User`:

[source, clojure]
----
(deftype User [firstname lastname])
----

Once the type has beed defined, we can create an instance of our `User`:

[source, clojure]
----
(def user (User. "Triss" "Merigold"))
----

And its fields can be accesset using the prefix-dot notation:

[source, clojure]
----
(.-firstname user)
;; => "Triss"
----

Types defined with deftype (and posteriory with defrecord) creates a host backed class like object
associated to the current namespace. But it has some peculiarities when we intend to use or import
it from other namespace. The types in _ClojureScript_ should be imported with `:import` directive
of `ns` macro:

[source, clojure]
----
(ns myns.core
  (:import otherns.User))

(User. "Cirilla" "Fiona")
----

For convenience, _ClojureScript_ also defines a constructor function caled `->User` that can be imported
with the common way using `:require` directive.

We personally do not like this type of functions, and we prefer define own constructors, with more
idiomatic names:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn user
  [firstname lastname]
  (User. firstname lastname))
----

And use it in our code instead of `->User`.


==== Defrecord

The record is a slightly higher level abstraction for define types in _ClojureScript_ and should be
prefered way to do it.

As we know, _ClojureScript_ tends to use plain data types how are the maps but in most cases we need
have a named type for represent the entities of our application. Here come the records.

A record is a datatype that implements a map protocols and therefore can be used like any other map.
And since records are also proper types, they support type-based polymorphism through protocols.

In summary: with records, we have the best of both worlds, maps that can play in in different
abstractions.

Let start defining the `User` type but using records:

[source, clojure]
----
(defrecord User [firstname lastname])
----

It looks really similar to deftype syntax, in fact, it uses deftype behind the scenes as low level
primitive for defining types.

Now, look the difference with raw types for access to its fields:

[source, clojure]
----
(def user (User. "Yennefer" "of Vengerberg"))

(:username user)
;; => "Yennefer"

(get user :username)
;; => "Yennefer"
----

As we mention previously, records are maps and acts like tham:

[source, clojure]
----
(map? user)
;; => true
----

And like maps, tham support extra fields that are not initially defined:

[source, clojure]
----
(def user2 (assoc user :age 92))

(:age user2)
;; => 92
----

As we can see, the `assoc` function works as is expected and return a new instance of the same
type but with new key value pair. But take care with `dissoc`, its behavior with records is slightly
different that with maps; it will return a new record if the field being dissociated is an optional
field, but it will return a plain map if you dissociate the mandatory field.

An other difference with maps is that records does not acts like functions:

[source, clojure]
----
(def plain-user {:username "Yennefer", :lastname "of Vengerberg"})

(plain-user :username)
;; => "Yennefer"

(user :username)
;; => user.User does not implements IFn protocol.
----

The `defrecord` macro like the `deftype`, for convenience esposes `->User` function, but with additional
one `map->User` constructor function. We have the same opionon about that constructors that with
deftype defined ones: we recommend define own instead of use that ones. But as they exists, let see
how they can be used:

[source, clojure]
----
(def cirilla (->User "Cirilla" "Fiona"))
(def yen (map->User {:firstname "Yennefer"
                     :lastname "of Vengerberg"}))
----


==== Implement protocols

Both type definition primitives that we have seen until now allows inline implementations for protocols
(explained in previous section). Let start define one for example purposes:

[source, clojure]
----
(defprotocol IUser
  "A common abstraction for work with user types."
  (full-name [_] "Get the full name of the user."))
----

Now, you can define a type with inline implementation for an abstraction, in our case the `IUser`:

[source, clojure]
----
(defrecord User [firstname lastname]
  IUser
  (full-name [_]
    (str firstname " " lastname)))

;; Create an instance.
(def user (User. "Yennefer" "of Vengerberg"))

(full-name user)
;; => "Yennefer of Vengerberg"

==== Reify

The `reify` macro lets you create an anonymous types that implement protocols. In difference with
deftype and defrecord, it does not has accessible fields.

This is a way how we can emulate an instance of user type and that plays well in `IUser` abstraction:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn user
  [firstname lastname]
  (reify
    IUser
    (full-name [_]
      (str firstname " " lastname))))

(def yen (user "Yennefer" "of Vengerberg"))
(full-name user)
;; => "Yennefer of Vengerberg"
----

The real purpose of reify is create anonymous types that plains in a concrete abstractions but
you do not want a type in self.


=== Host interoperability

_ClojureScript_ in the same way as it brother Clojure, is designed to be a "Guest" language. It means
that the design of the language fits very well to work on to of existing ecosystem such as javascript
for _ClojureScript_ and jvm for _Clojure_.


==== The types.

_ClojureScript_ unlike expected, try takes advantage of every type that the platform provides. This
is a maybe incomplete list of things that _ClojureScript_ inherits and reuse from the underlying
platform:

* _ClojureScript_ strings are javascript *Strings*.
* _ClojureScript_ numbers are javascript *Numbers*.
* _ClojureScript_ `nil` is a javascript *null*.
* _ClojureScript_ regular expressions are javascript `RegExp` instances.
* _ClojureScript_ is not interpreted, is always compiled town to the javascript.
* _ClojureScript_ allows easy call platform apis with the same semantics.
* _ClojureScript_ data types internally compiles to objects in javascript.

On top of it, _ClojureScript_ buid own abstractions and types that are does not exists in the
platform, such as Vectors, Maps, Sets, and others that are explained in previous chapters.


==== Interacting with platform types

_ClojureScript_ comes with a little set of special forms that allows interact with platform
types such as calling object methods, creating new instances and accessing to object
properties.


===== Access to the platform

_ClojureScript_ has a special syntax for access to the all platform environment through the
`js/` special namespace. This is the aspect of the expression for execute the javascript's
builtin `parseInt` function:

[source, clojure]
----
(js/parseInt "222")
;; => 222
----


===== Creating new instances

_ClojureScript_ has two ways to create instances:

.Using the `new` special form
[source, clojure]
----
(new js/Regex "^foo$")
----

Using the `.` special form
[source, clojure]
----
(js/Regex. "^foo$")
----

The last one is the recommended way to do that operation. We do not aware of real differences
between the two forms, but in the clojurescript comunity the last one is the most adopted.


===== Invoke instance methods

For invoke methods of some object instance, in contrary to how it used in javascript (eg:
`obj.method()`, the method name comes first like any other standard function in lisp languages
but with little variation: the function name starts with special form `.`.

Let see how we can call the `.test()` method of regexp instance:

[source, clojure]
----
(def re (js/RegExp "^foo"))

(.test re "foobar")
;; => true
----


===== Access to object properties

Access to the object properties is really very similar to call a method, the difference is that
instead of using the `.` we should use the `.-`. Let see an example:

[source, clojure]
----
(.-multiline re)
;; => false
----


===== Javascrpt objects

_ClojureScript_ has different ways for create plain javascript objects, each one has its own
purpose. The basic one is the `js-obj` function. It accepts a variable length of pairs of key
values and return a javascript object:

[source, clojure]
----
(js-obj "foo" "bar")
;; => #js {:foo "bar"}
----

The return value can be passed to some kind of third party library that accepts a plain
javascript objects. But you can observe the repl representation of the return value of this
function. It is exactly the other form for do the same thing.

Using the reader macro `#js` consists of prepend it to the clojure map or vector and the
result will be transformed to plain javascript:

[source, clojure]
----
(def myobj #js {:foo "bar"})
----

The translation of that to plain javascript is similar to this:

[source, javascript]
----
var myobj = {foo: "bar"};
----


As explained in previous section, you also can access to the plain object properties using
the `.-` syntax:

[source, clojure]
----
(.-foo myobj)
;; => "bar"
----

And as javascript objects are mutable, you can set a new value to some property using
the `set!` function:

[source, clojure]
----
(set! (.-foo myobj) "baz")
----


===== Conversions

The inconvenience of previously explained forms, is that they does not make recursive
transformatios, so if you have nested objects, the nested objects do not will be converted.
For solve that use cases, _ClojureScript_ comes with `clj->js` and `js->clj` functions
that transforms clojure collection types into javascript and in reverse order:

[source, clojure]
----
(clj->js {:foo {:bar "baz"}})
;; => #js {:foo #js {:bar "baz"}}
----

In case of arrays, it there a specialized function `into-array` that behaves as it expected:

[source, clojure]
----
(into-array ["foo"])
;; => #js ["foo"]
----


===== Arrays

In previous example we have seen how we can create an array from existing _ClojureScript_
collection. But it there other function for create arrays: `make-array`.

.Creating a preallocated array with length 10
[source, clojure]
----
(def a (make-array 10))
;; => #js [nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil]
----

In _ClojureScript_ arrays are also play well in sequence abstraction so you can iterate
over it or simple get the number of elements with `count` function:

[source, clojure]
----
(count a)
;; => 10
----

As arrays are platform mutable collection type, you can acces to a concrete index and set
value to on that position:

[source, clojure]
----
(aset a 0 2)
;; => 2
----

Or access in a indexed way to it values:

[source, clojure]
----
(aget a 0)
;; => 2
----

In javascript, the objects are also arrays, so you can use the same functions for interacting
with plain objects:

[source, clojure]
----
(def b #js {:foo "bar"})
;; => #js {:foo "bar"}

(aget b "foo")
;; => "bar"

(aset b "baz" "bar")
;; => "bar"

b
;; => #js {:foo "bar", :baz "bar"}
----


=== State management

TBD


=== Truthiness

This is the aspect where the each language has its own semantics, the majority of languages
treats empty collections, the 0 integer and other things like this are considered false.
In _ClojureScript_ unlike in other languages only two values are considered as false: `nil`
and `false`, Everything except them, are treated as `true`.

So, thanks to it, sets can be considered also predicates, so if them return a value so it exists
and if it return `nil` so the value does not exists:

[source, clojure]
----
(def s #{1 2})

(s 1)
;; => 1

(s 3)
;; => nil
----
