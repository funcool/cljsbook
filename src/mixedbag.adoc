=== REPL-driven development with figwheel

In this project, we will *not* do “Hello World”&#8212;that has been done to death. Instead,
this project will be a web page that asks you for your age in years and tells you how many days
that is, using an approximation of 365 days per year.

In this project, we will use the _figwheel_ template to build the project structure. Let’s call
the project `age` and create it by typing:

[source,bash]
----
$ lein new figwheel age
Retrieving figwheel/lein-template/0.3.5/lein-template-0.3.5.pom from clojars
Retrieving figwheel/lein-template/0.3.5/lein-template-0.3.5.jar from clojars
Generating fresh 'lein new' figwheel project.
$ cd age # move into newly created project directory
----

The project has the following structure:

----
age
├── .gitignore
├── project.clj
├── README.md
├── resources
│   └── public
│       ├── css
│       │   └── style.css
│       └── index.html
└── src
    └── age
        └── core.cljs
----

The `project.clj` file contains information that Leiningen uses to download dependencies and build the project. For
now, just trust that everything in that file is exactly as it should be.

Open the `index.html` file and add the `<meta>` element to the head of the document, and modify
the body as follows:

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app">
      <h1>Age in Days</h1>
      <p>Enter your age in years:
        <input type="text" size="5" id="years" /></p>
      <p id="feedback"></p>
    </div>
    <script src="js/compiled/age.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </body>
</html>
----

The `core.cljs` file is where all the action takes place. For now, leave it exactly as it
is, and start the figwheel environment, which will load a large number of dependencies
and start a server.

[source,bash]
----
[age] $ lein fighwheel
# much output
Prompt will show when figwheel connects to your application
----

If you are using Linux or Mac OS X, type the command as `rlwrap lein figwheel`
In your browser, go to URL `http://localhost:3449`, and you will see something like
the following screenshot if you open up the web console.

The terminal will then give you a REPL prompt:

[source,bash]
----
To quit, type: :cljs/quit
cljs.user=> 
----

For now, do what it says in the `core.cljs` file -- change the `(println...)` and then save the file. When you do so, you will see the change reflected immediately in the browser.

Then make an error by adding an extra closing parenthesis to the `println`. When you save the file,
will see a compile error in the browser window.

==== Interacting with JavaScript

In the REPL window, type the following to invoke JavaScript’s `window.alert()` function:

[source]
----
cljs.user=> (.alert js/window "It works!")
nil
----

The general format for invoking a JavaScript function from ClojureScript is to give the function name (preceded by a dot), the object that “owns” the function, and any parameters to that function.
You should see an alert appear in your browser winodw; when you dismiss the alert, the REPL will
print `nil` and give you another prompt. You can also do it this way:

[source]
----
cljs.user=> (js/alert "It works!")
nil
----

However, the first version always works, so, for consistency, we will use that notation throughout.
You can create objects by using their class name followed by a dot, and you can
call methods on any JavaScript objects:

[source]
----
cljs.user=> (def d (js/Date.))
#inst "2015-06-30T01:38:21.764-00:00"
cljs.user=> (.getFullYear d)
2015
cljs.user=> (.toUpperCase "abc")
"ABC"
cljs.user=> (.getElementById js/document "years")
#<[object HTMLInputElement]>
----

From that last example, you can see where we’re going. To retrieve an object’s property, use a `.-`
before the property name. In the browser window, type a number into the input field
(in the example, we typed `24`), then do this in the REPL.

[source]
----
cljs.user=> ;; for convenience define a variable
cljs.user=> (def year-field (.getElementById js/document "years"))
#<[object HTMLInputElement]>
cljs.user=> (.-value year-field)
"24"
cljs.user=> (set! (.-value year-field) "25")
"25"
----

This works, but it is little more than direct translation of JavaScript to ClojureScript. The next
step is to add event handling to the button. Event handling is loaded with all sorts of cross-platform
compatibility issues, so we’d like one step up from plain ClojureScript.  The solution is the Google Closure library.

=== The Closure Library

The good people at Google wrote a library named _Closure_ that does all that hard cross-platform
work for you. _Closure_ is also the name of their optimizing compiler that generates JavaScript that 
only includes the functions you need from the libraries that you use.

To use Closure, you have to modify the `:require` clause at the beginning of `core.cljs`

[source,clojure]
----
(ns ^:figwheel-always age.core
    (:require [goog.dom :as dom]
              [goog.events :as events]))
----

Getting an element and setting its value is slightly easier. Do this in the REPL and see the
results in the browser window.

[source]
----
cljs.user=> (in-ns 'age.core)
age.core=> (def y (dom/getElement "years"))
#<[object HTMLInputElement]>
age.core=> (set! (.-value y) "26")
"26"
age.core=> (dom/setTextContent (dom/getElement "feedback") "This works!")
----

To add an event, you define a function that takes a single argument (the event to be handled),
and then tell the appropriate HTML element to listen for it. the `events/listen` function takes
three arguments: the element to listen to, the event to listen for, and the function that will
handle the event.

[source]
----
age.core=> (defn testing [evt] (js/alert "Responding to click"))
#<function age$core$testing(evt){
return alert("Responding to click");
}>
age.core=> (events/listen (dom/getElement "calculate") "click" testing)
#<[object Object]>
----

After doing this, the browser should respond to a click on the button.
If you would like to remove the listener, use `unlisten`.

[source]
----
age.core=> (events/unlisten (dom/getElement "calculate") "click" testing)
true
----

Now, put that all together in the `core.cljs` file as follows:

[source, clojure]
----
(ns ^:figwheel-always age.core
    (:require [goog.dom :as dom]
              [goog.events :as events]))

(enable-console-print!)

(defn calculate [event]
  (let [years (.parseInt js/window (.-value (dom/getElement "years")))
        days (* 365 years)]
        (dom/setTextContent (dom/getElement "feedback")
          (str "That is " days " days old."))))

(defn on-js-reload [])

(events/listen (dom/getElement "calculate") "click" calculate)
