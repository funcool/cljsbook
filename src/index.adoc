== About this book

This book covers the ClojureScript programming language, a detailed guide of its tooling for
development and a series of articles about topics that are applicable in day-to-day programming
in ClojureScript.

It is not an introductory book to programming in that it assumes the reader has experience programming in at least
one language. However, it doesn't assume experience with ClojureScript or functional programming. We'll try to
include links to reference material when talking about the theoretical programming language aspects of ClojureScript
that may be not be familiar to everybody.

Also, since the ClojureScript documentation is good but disperse, we wanted to write a compendium of reference
information and extensive examples to serve as a ClojureScript primer as well as a series of practical how-to's.
This document will evolve with the ClojureScript language, both as a reference of the language features and a
sort of cookbook with practical programming recipes.

You'll get the most ouf this book if you:

- are curious about ClojureScript or functional programming and you have some programming experience;
- write JavaScript or any other language that compiles to it and want to know what ClojureScript has to offer;
- you already know some Clojure and want to learn how ClojureScript differs from it, plus practical topics like
  how to target both languages with the same code base.

Don't be turned off if you don't see yourself in neither of the above groups, we encourage you to give this book
a try and give us feedback on how we can make it more accesible. Our goal is to make ClojureScript more friendly
to newcomers and spread the ideas about programming that Clojure has helped popularize, as we see a lot of
value in them.


== Introduction

This chapter is an introduction to the Clojure ecosystem, and intends to explain
the philosophy behind it.

== The language.

This chapter will be a little introduction to ClojureScript without assumptions about previous
knowledge of the Clojure language, providing a quick tour over all the things you will need to know
in order to understand the rest of this book.

== Tooling & Compiler

This chapter will cover a little introduction to existing tooling for making things easy when
developing using ClojureScript. It will cover:

* Using the repl
* Leiningen and cljsbuild
* Google Closure Library
* Modules
* Unit testing
* Library development
* Browser based development
* Server based development

Unlike the previous chapter, this chapter intends to tell different stories each independent of each other.

== Mixed Bag

This chapter will cover miscellaneous topics that are not classified in the previous ones. This is a
"catchall" section and will touch a bunch of heterogeneus topics like:

* Async primitives using the _core.async_ library.
* Working with promises.
* Error handling using the _cats_ library.
* Pattern matching with the _core.match_ library.
* Web development using the Om library.
* Share code between clojure and clojurescript.
